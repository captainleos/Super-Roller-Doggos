Desert High

This template mainly analyzes terrain slopes, satellite image's pixels and landcover
data to detect flat & jagged areas on map for close to real-world texturing
distribution and vegetation placement.

There will be medium density bushes in flat areas and high density vegetation around
water elements of rivers and lakes on map. There will be jagged rocks on higher
slopes.

Distribution of elements will be done by high density, resolution & distance settings.
