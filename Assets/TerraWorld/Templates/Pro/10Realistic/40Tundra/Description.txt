Tundra High

This template mainly analyzes terrain slopes, satellite image's pixels and landcover
data to detect low and high altitude areas on map for close to real-world texturing
distribution and assets placement.

There will be high density of dry plants in flat areas with no trees scattering.

Distribution of elements will be done by high density, resolution & distance settings.

Note: Earth locations with Tundra biome have low resolution to no available data in
most of the regions. Setting lower values in nodes may help to get better results.
